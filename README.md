# vaibhav-vuln-lab
vaibhav-vuln-lab is a personal vulnerability testing lab built for ethical hacking practice. It includes automated setup scripts and guides for DVWA, Nessus, phishing simulations, ARP poisoning, and DNS spoofing—ideal for learning how real-world exploits work in a safe, sandboxed environment. For educational use only.

vaibhav-vuln-lab is my personal security lab built for ethical hacking practice and hands-on learning. This repo includes automated scripts and setup guides for deploying vulnerable applications, scanning systems, and simulating real-world attacks—like phishing, ARP poisoning, and DNS spoofing—all within a safe, sandboxed environment.
Whether you’re a student exploring cybersecurity or a professional prepping for red-team scenarios, these tools offer a practical way to understand how vulnerabilities work and how they’re exploited. Use this lab responsibly—it's meant strictly for educational purposes.
